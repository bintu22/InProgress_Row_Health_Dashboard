# Row Health Dashboard & Marketing Insights
# Overview
**Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories** spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates. 

Now that theyâ€™ve hired a new data team and are strategizing their marketing budget for the year, the company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. **As a data analyst at Row Health, I was asked to build visualizations** to enable the marketing team to self-serve insights and regular-cadence reporting.

## ERD
Elist's database structure as seen below consists of three tables: customers, campaigns, claims, with a total row count of 66,393 records.

## Insights Summary
In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following key metrics:
* **Signup Rate:** The percent of people who see a campaign and subsequently sign up for a Row Health plan.
* **Cost per Signup:** The average dollars spent in order to acquire a signup from each campaign.
* **Click through Rate:** The percent of people who see a campaign and click on the associated link.
